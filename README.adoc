== Versions

* Latest *released* versions were {released-versions} - they died with jFrog
* Latest working versions are {working-versions} (in this repo) using Apache Shiro 1.13.0
* Next version will be {next-version} using Apache Shiro 2.0.1 compatible with Grails 5 and Java 11+
and will be released in maven.

This is the Grails Shiro plugin for *Grails version 4.0.x and Shiro 1.13.0*.

This project was derived from the Grails 2.x version
(https://github.com/pledbrook/grails-shiro).

We pretty much re-wrote the plugin for Grails 3 & 4 and to simplify the use, improve the documentation
and make it easier to maintain. There are lots of changes please check out the
https://github.com/nerdErg/grails-shiro/blob/master/docs/Guide.adoc[Guide] in the docs directory.

=== Numbering

In general the version number is following the Grails major version it supports, then release. e.g.

[subs="attributes"]
----
3.{release} = Grails 3 plugin release {release}
4.{release} = Grails 4 plugin release {release}
----

=== Maintenance
Although we have now published the Grails 4 version of this plugin we will continue to maintain the Grails 3 version
backporting features till July 2020 where possible.

=== Documentation and Source

In general the documentation applies to both Grails 3 and 4 versions of the plugin. Source code including specific documentation
for the Grails 3 version can be found in the *Grails-3 Branch*.

== Installation

To install, add this to your `build.gradle` dependencies for Grails 4:

[subs="attributes"]
----
compile "org.grails.plugins:grails-shiro:4.{release}"
----
and this for Grails 3:

[subs="attributes"]
----
compile "org.grails.plugins:grails-shiro:3.{release}"
----
== Getting started

If you're implementing your security from scratch, then you can simply install grails-shiro by adding

[subs="attributes"]
----
compile "org.grails.plugins:grails-shiro:4.{release}"
----
to your build.gradle dependencies and typing
shiro quick start, https://github.com/nerdErg/grails-shiro/blob/master/docs/Guide.adoc#shiro-quick-start['grails shiro-quick-start'].

This will create a ShiroWildcardDbRealm in your `grails-app/realms` directory and make a ShiroUser and ShiroRole domain
class. It will also create an AuthController to let you log in. Check out
https://github.com/nerdErg/grails-shiro/blob/master/docs/Guide.adoc#wildcard-db-realm[Wildcard DB Realm] for how you might populate
a couple of users using Boostrap.groovy.

Now to Control access to a Controller add an Interceptor for that controller using
`https://github.com/nerdErg/grails-shiro/blob/master/docs/Guide.adoc#create-shiro-controller-interceptor[grails create-shiro-controller-interceptor] MyController` which will add
https://github.com/nerdErg/grails-shiro/blob/master/docs/Guide.adoc#permission-string-conventions[access control by convention].
